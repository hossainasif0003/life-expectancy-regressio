## Project Description

This project analyzes a Life Expectancy dataset using multiple regression techniques to model and predict life expectancy based on socioeconomic factors.

The main steps in this analysis include:

- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing data with mean or median imputation based on skewness
- Data cleaning and duplicate removal
- Feature engineering and correlation analysis
- Visualization with bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots
- Regression modeling using:
  - Simple Linear Regression
  - Multiple Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression (1D and multi-feature)
  - Polynomial Regression with pipeline including scaling
- Model evaluation using RÂ² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Comparison of model performances

- Country
- GDP
- Population
- Income composition of resources
- Life expectancy
- Total expenditure
- Schooling
- And other relevant variables

> **Note:** Update the dataset filepath in the script to match your local file location.
